The phosphate problem arises due to the low phosphate solubility as it tends to precipitate in a form of apatite in the presence of calcium. At the same time, it is one of the most important compounds in the formation of the first cellular compounds such as phospholipids or nucleic acids. \n",

                "However, `Toner2020` show that early Earth conditions differed in many ways from today, including significantly higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures may have led to carbonation of brines and then precipitation of calcium carbonate in the brines on the early Earth. Lower calcium concentrations in the brines would then have allowed higher phosphate concentrations, creating suitable conditions for the formation of the first cells on Earth.\n",

At present-day pCO<sub>2</sub> levels (log<sub>10</sub>(pCO<sub>2</sub>) = −3.5), solutions are highly alkaline (pH approximate to 10), consistent with high pHs measured in modern soda lakes. However, in CO<sub>2</sub>-rich atmospheres on the early Earth (log<sub>10</sub>(pCO<sub>2</sub>) = −2 to 0), brines range from moderately alkaline (with pH = 9) to slightly acidic (pH = 6.5) because of acidification by CO<sub>2</sub> (see the plot below). Below, we plot pH levels with the [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) plotting library. We note that those are the maximum values for the corresponding solution, as it is saturated with respect to carbonate minerals. For undersaturated solutions, the pH is always lower. We see that temperature also affects the pH levels, because CO<sub>2</sub> is more soluble in solutions at lower temperatures, making pH slightly higher."
